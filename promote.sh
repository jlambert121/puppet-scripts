#!/usr/bin/env bash
# == Synopsis
# This is a small script that will promote the develop branches in each git
# submodule in the Puppet staging environment to master, then then pull in
# the changes to the production environment. Note that you can promote single
# commits by using the cherry-pick (-c) functionality. If you use cherry pick
# you must pass a modulename, ie 'grumps-modules' or 'manifests', with the -m
# switch. You can also promote sets of changes related to a ticket, as long
# as the developer remembers to put the ticket number in the commit message.
#
# == Usage
# See usage() function below
#
# == Notes
# This script does serious changes and pushes to master. Don't run it all
# willy nilly.
